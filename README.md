# keyhunt

Tool for hunt privatekeys for crypto currencies that use secp256k1 elliptic curve

Post: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5322040.0

Work for Bitcoin
- address compress or uncompress
- hashes rmd160 compress or uncompress
- publickeys compress or uncompress

Work for Ethereum
- address

# TL:DR

- Download and build
- Run against puzzle 66 (address mode)

```
./keyhunt -m address -f tests/66.txt -b 66 -l compress -R -q -s 10

```

You need to add `-t numberThreads` to get better speed

- Run against Puzzle 125 (bsgs mode)

```
./keyhunt -m bsgs -f tests/125.txt -b 125 -q -s 10 -R
```

You need to add `-t numberThreads` and `-k factor` to get better speed

## Free Code

This code is free of charge, see the licence for more details. https://github.com/albertobsd/keyhunt/blob/main/LICENSE

Although this project is a hobby for me, it still involves a considerable amount of work.
If you would like to support this project, please consider donating at https://github.com/albertobsd/keyhunt#donations.


# Disclaimer

I made this tool as a generic tool for the Puzzles.
I recommend to everyone to stay in puzzles

Several of users request me to add support for ethereum and minikeys, I did it.
But again i recommend only use this program for puzzles.

## For regular users

Please read the CHANGELOG.md to see the new changes

# Download and build

This program was made in a linux environment.
if you are windows user i strongly recommend to use WSL enviroment on Windows.
it is available in the Microsoft store

Please install on your system

- git
- build-essential

for legacy version also you are going to need:

- libssl-dev
- libgmp-dev

On Debian based systems, run this commands to update your current enviroment
and install the tools needed to compile it

```
apt update && apt upgrade
apt install git -y
apt install build-essential -y
apt install libssl-dev -y
apt install libgmp-dev -y
```

To clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/albertobsd/keyhunt.git
```

don't forget change to the keyhunt directory (But i'm not here to teach you linux commands)

```
cd keyhunt
```

First compile:

```
make
```

if you have problems compiling the `main` version you can compile the `legacy` version

```
make legacy
```


and then execute with `-h` to see the help

```
./keyhunt -h
```

## Â¡Beta!

This version is still a **beta** version, there are a lot of things that can be fail or improve.
This version also could have some bugs. please report it.

# Modes

Keyhunt can work in diferent ways at different speeds.

The current availables modes are:
- address
- rmd160
- xpoint
- bsgs

## Experimental modes

- minikeys
- pub2rmd

## address mode

This is the most basic approach to work, in this mode your text file need to have a list of the publicaddress to be search.

Example of address from solved puzzles, this file is already on the repository `tests/1to32.txt`

```
1BgGZ9tcN4rm9KBzDn7KprQz87SZ26SAMH
1CUNEBjYrCn2y1SdiUMohaKUi4wpP326Lb
...
```

To target that file we need to execute keyhunt with this line

`./keyhunt -m address -f tests/1to32.txt -r 1:FFFFFFFF`

output:
```

```

In this mode you can specify to seach only address compressed or uncompressed with `-l compress` or  `-l uncompress`

Test your luck with the random parameter `-R` againts the puzzle #66

```
./keyhunt -m address -f tests/66.txt -b 66 -l compress -R -q -s 10
```

Please note the change from `-r 1:FFFFFFFF` to `-b 66`, with -b you can specify the bit range

### vanity search.

To search only one vanity address is with `1Good1` or with `1MyKey` use the next command

full command

```
./keyhunt -m vanity -l compress -R -b 256 -v 1Good1 -v 1MyKey

```

All the vanity address and his privatekeys will be saved in the file `VANITYKEYFOUND.txt` of your current directory


## rmd160 mode

rmd stands for RIPE Message Digest (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIPEMD )

mode rmd160 work in the same way than address, but the diference is that file need to have hash rmd160 instead of addresses.


example file `tests/1to32.rmd` :

```
751e76e8199196d454941c45d1b3a323f1433bd6

9652d86bedf43ad264362e6e6eba6eb764508127
...
```

to target that file you need to execute the next line:

```
./keyhunt -m rmd160 -f tests/1to32.rmd -r 1:FFFFFFFF -l compress -s 5
```

output:

```

## xpoint mode

This method can target the X value of the publickey in the same way that the tool search for address or rmd160 hash, this tool can search for the X values

The speed for this method is better than the speed for address or rmd160

The input file can had one publickey per line compress or uncompress:

- Publickey Compress (66 hexcharacters)
- Publickey Uncompress (130 hexcharacters)

Example input file:

A few substracted values from puzzle *40*

```

```


Now you can use keyhunt against some thousand values of the puzzle 40:

```./keyhunt -m xpoint -f tests/substracted40.txt -n 65536 -t 4 -b 40```

Output:

rmd160 7c92500fa9d2ecbca5bdd61bb6a14a249669bae4

```

After the hit we need to search the substracted index and make a simple math operation to get the real privatek:

```
0274241b684e7c31e7933510b510aa14de9ac88ec3635bdd35a3bcf1d16da210be # + 453856235784
```
The Operation is `800258a2ce` hex (+/-) in this case + `453856235784` decimal equals to `E9AE4933D6`

This is an easy example, I been trying the puzzle 120 with more than 500 millions of substracted keys and no luck.

Test you luck with the puzzle 120 with xpoint:

```./keyhunt -m xpoint -f tests/120.txt -t 4 -b 125 -R -q```

## Endomorphism

To enable endomorphism use `-e`

endomorphism is only enabled for `address`, `rdm160` , `vanity` and `xpoint`


But what the heck is `Endomorphism`?

In few words for elliptic curves, an endomorphism is a function that maps points on the curve to other points on the same curve.

One kind of Endomorphism is the Point negation by example the privatekey from puzzle 64 

000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000f7051f27b09112d4 publickey 03100611c54dfef604163b8358f7b7fac13ce478e02cb224ae16d45526b25d9d4d
if we negated that private or publickey we get:

fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffebaaedce6af48a03ac8cd3f651fa52e6d publickey 02100611c54dfef604163b8358f7b7fac13ce478e02cb224ae16d45526b25d9d4d

But if we negated this last value we get again the first value.

There are some special values lambda y beta

```
lambda = 0x5363ad4cc05c30e0a5261c028812645a122e22ea20816678df02967c1b23bd72
beta = 0x7ae96a2b657c07106e64479eac3434e99cf0497512f58995c1396c28719501ee
```

For every privatekey K and its Point Q where Q = GK 

Q = (x,y)

We can multuply Q by lambda example:

```
Q * lambda = (x * beta mod p , y)
Q*lambda is a Scalar Multiplication
x*beta is just a Multiplication (Very fast
```

p is 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEFFFFFC2F

```

but if we multiply 0xd6db1c1a53e70276bafb7872b02e7df048f179191432c9a5b73ad10619cb9133 again by lambda

Result: 0xf7051f27b09112d4

```

What the heck?? We go back to the first key, wow!!

So for each key that we compute, we can get easy 6 values more This values Are:

```
Original Point, Original Point negated
Original Point * lambda,  Original Point * lambda negated
Original Point * lambda^2,  Original Point * lambda^2 negated
```

Obiously we need to do the operations with the X value multiplied by *beta* becasue it is more faster and we are going to get the same result

*Endomorphism don't work for puzzles because 5 of those 6 keys are outside of the range*

I added endomorphism to speed up the vanity search process, but i extended it for all other methods that i mentioned before


## pub2rmd mode

This method is made to try to get the puzzles publickey key it works a little more faster because it skip the EC Operations

The input file need to have the hash RMD160 of the address without publickey leaked:

To target that file you need to do:

```./keyhunt -m pub2rmd -f tests/puzzleswopublickey.txt -t 6 -q```

Output:

You can let it run for a while together with others scripts, if you get one of those publickeys now you can target it with a better method like bsgs or another tools like kangaroo


## bsgs mode (baby step giant step)

Keyhunt implement the BSGS algorithm to search privatekeys for a known public key.

The input file need to have a list of publickeys compress or uncompress those publickey can be mixed in the same file, one public key per line and any other word followed by an space is ignored example of the file:

```
043ffa1cc011a8d23dec502c7656fb3f93dbe4c61f91fd443ba444b4ec2dd8e6f0406c36edf3d8a0dfaa7b8f309b8f1276a5c04131762c23594f130a023742bdde # 0000000000000000000000000000000000800000000000000000100000000000
046534b9e9d56624f5850198f6ac462f482fec8a60262728ee79a91cac1d60f8d6a92d5131a20f78e26726a63d212158b20b14c3025ebb9968c890c4bab90bfc69 # 0000000000000000000000000000000000800000000000000000200000000000
```

This example contains 2 publickeys followed by his privatekey just to test the correct behavior of the application.

*Don't load more than 100 or 1000 publickeys* if you lad more than it will take a long long time in update the speed counter and the speed will be very low.

btw any word followed by and space after the publickey is ignored the file can be only the publickeys:

```
043ffa1cc011a8d23dec502c7656fb3f93dbe4c61f91fd443ba444b4ec2dd8e6f0406c36edf3d8a0dfaa7b8f309b8f1276a5c04131762c23594f130a023742bdde

```

### File creation

the bsgs mode `-m bsgs` now can create automatically the files needed to speed up the initial load process of keyhunt this is the bloom filters creation and the bp table creation.

To request to keyhunt to create those files automatically use `-S` Capital S for SAVE and READ files.
The 3 files needed for keyhunt can vary from size depending of your values of `-n` and `-k` , so make your test and stick to one combination of (n,k) values or you can end with hundreds of unnesesary files.

The 3 Files size are the same amount of memory used in runtime.

The files are created if they don't exist when you run the program the first time.

example of file creation:

```
./keyhunt -m bsgs -f tests/125.txt -R -b 125 -q -S -s 10

All the next examples were made with the `-S` option I just ommit that part of the output to avoid confutions use `-S` if you want, but remember with a great `-n` there must also come great files

### Examples

To try to find those privatekey this is the line of execution:

```
time ./keyhunt -m bsgs -f tests/test120.txt -b 120 -S
```

We can speed up our process selecting a bigger K value `-k value` btw the n value is the total length of item tested in the radom range, a bigger k value means more ram to be use:

Example:
```
./keyhunt -m bsgs -f tests/125.txt -b 125 -R -k 20 -S
```

Note the value of N `0xfffff000000` with k = 20 this mean that the N value is less than the default value `0x100000000000` that is because k is not a 2^X number

if you want to more Speed use a bigger -k value like 128, it will use some 2 GB of RAM

Warning: the default n value have a maximun K of `4096` if that value is exceed the program can have an unknow behavior or suboptimal speed.
If you want to use a bigger K I recomend use a bigger N value `-n 0x400000000000` and half your K value.

Amount of RAM used ~4.5 GB, time to solve the sixteen public keys in the range of 64 bits key-space: 164 min (~2.7 hrs) using 6 threads

if we run the same command with `-n 0x1000000000000000 -k 4 -t 6` it use ~18 GB or RAM and solve the same keys in 60 minutes

There are several variations to play with the values `-n` and `-k` but there are some minimal values required, n can not be less than 1048576 (2^20)

To get optimal performance the k values need to be base 2^x values, this is 1,2,4,8,16,32 ...

**If you exceed the max value of K the program can have a unknow behavior, the program can have a suboptimal performance, or in the wrong cases you can missing some hits and have an incorrect SPEED.**

Note for user that want use it with SWAP memory. IT DOESN'T WORK with Swap Memory was made to small chucks of memory also is slowly.

## Is my speed real?

Since this is still a beta version we can have some doubt about the speed showed in the bsgs mode.

To check this  i prepare a set of test publickeys to be found at some specific time according to your speed.

With  1 Petakeys/s the publickey will be found in 2 minutes:
Privatekey: 8000000000000001aa535d3d0c0000
Publickey : 02af4535880d694d660031a161c53a6889c45d2de513454858e94739f9c790768b

Select one publickey that fit to your current speed save it in a file `testpublickey.txt` and test it with:

```
./keyhunt -m bsgs -f testpublickey.txt -b 120 -q
```

Change the values of k, n and t


The publickeys should be found in some 2 minutes after the load of the files

Change your n or k values according to your current memory and remember not exceed the k value of each N please check the table https://github.com/albertobsd/keyhunt#valid-n-and-k-values


## minikeys Mode

This mode is some experimental.

For the moment only Minikeys of 22 characters are available

The minikey are generated from a 16 byte buffer using the base58 encode funtion using the bitcoin  string `123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz` any sugestion please let me know.

The input file can be an addresses or rmd hashes list of the target keys


Command example:

```
./keyhunt -m minikeys -f tests/minikeys.txt -C SG64GZqySYwBm9KxE1wJ28 -n 0x10000
```

Output:

# Ethereum

Finally ethereum address are supported, for ethereum there are no modes exect for address.

if you have publickeys for ethereum you can use xpoint or bsgs mode.

to test the functionality of ethereum you can use the sample file `tests/1to32.eth`

command: 

```
./keyhunt -c eth -f tests/1to32.eth -r 1:100000000 -M
```

output:

## Speeds

I already explain the speed for BSGS

But since there is new updates for other modes I want to clarify it.

For the modes `address`, `rmd160`, `xpoint` and `vanity`

Each thread works in groups of 1024 keys, so every time that one inner-cycle 
of each thread is finished the code update its own coutner in 1

```
steps[thread_number]++;
```

So every step represent 1024 keys scanned.

if you enabled endomorphism, the total steps are multiplied by 6 for modes `address`, `rmd160` and `vanity`.
Becuase with endomorphism we checking  efectively 6 different keys every step
 
For `xpoint` mode plus endomorphism the number is only is multiplied by 3 only becasue we only care
about the X value and we don't need the negated values ( mirror Y axis)

Special case for `compress` search of the modes`address`, `rmd160` and `vanity` 
WITHOUT `endomorphism` enabled, for this conditions the speed is multipied by 2 
because we are checking efectively 2 keys the program calculate one X value and 
it is checking both prefixes `02 + X value` and `03 + X value`, this is NOT optional
Y try to do it without this behavior but in that case the speed is worse

This is important because if you targeting an specific range with `compress` and WITHOUT endomorphism by examples puzzles
 the efective speed is half of the showed speed by the program
But if you are targeting all the curve then the showed speed is correct.

## FAQ

- Where the privatekeys will be saved?
R: In a file called `KEYFOUNDKEYFOUND.txt`

- Can I save the bloomfilter and table to speed up the process?
R: Yes use only `-S` always that you run the program it works for:
`bsgs`, `address`, `rmd160`, `minikeys`, `xpoint` it don't work for `vanity`
The files will be generated automatically in the current directory

- Why the speed for bsgs say 0 keys/s
R: this was asked here https://github.com/albertobsd/keyhunt/issues/69 and 
here https://github.com/albertobsd/keyhunt/issues/108 and also others in telegram

Please check the video that i made to answer that https://youtu.be/MVby8mYNxbI

- Is available for Windows?
R: It can be compiled with mingw, but i strongly recomend WSL with Ubuntu for windows 10
